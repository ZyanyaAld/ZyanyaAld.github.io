## Bio

Zyanya Valentina Velazquez Aldrete is an undergraduate researcher in Genomic 
Sciences at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Her work 
bridges molecular microbiology, evolutionary genomics, and systems biology 
through the integration of experimental and computational approaches.

She is currently involved in three research lines: antimicrobial discovery 
from environmental bacterial isolates, mathematical modeling of pulmonary 
fibrosis dynamics, and comparative genomics of aging and longevity in reptiles. 
Her research interests include phylogenetic comparative methods, evolutionary 
analysis, genome-wide data integration, and the development of minimal 
mathematical models to understand biological regulation and disease-associated 
transitions.

She works primarily in R, Python, and Linux-based environments, focusing on 
reproducible computational workflows and quantitative biological analysis.
